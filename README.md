# Cardless Security System
***
## Project Description
A **cardless security system** based on human **electro cardiogram (ECG) biometrics** that will be able to identify specified individuals, assess their authorization privileges and subsequently permit or deny access to
restricted areas. The entry regulation method is a custom designed electronic door locking
mechanism. Device is includes additional security features to prevent unauthorized entry. The unit
itself is battery operated with audio and visual indicators used to denote various system states.

## Goals and Objectives
1) Differentiate between individuals based on personal ECG signals
2) A secure mechanical locking system driven by an electric motor
## Brief Background
Most biometric identification devices currently in use throughout the world rely on either facial,
fingerprint, retina, or voice recognition systems. All of these authentication methods have been shown to
produce unique signatures that remain relatively consistent over time and are difficult to emulate with
the notable exception of voice based systems. Although obviously less secure the appeal of audio
biometric systems is driven primarily by its substantially lower implementation costs as opposed to the
other metrics which require sophisticated vision hardware. This desire for inexpensive biometric devices
has driven the search for alternative unique human signatures. Over the last few years electrocardiogram
(ECG) based recognition has shown potential. One of the advantages of this metric include the fact it is
an internal signal which is highly subject to personal health and mental state and is thus difficult to
procure from unwilling or deceased individuals. It is also fairly inexpensive to both capture and process
the ECG signals leading to a very high overall desirability. Research into this field is still being
conducted and very few viable commercial products are currently available.

## Final Result
An enclosed printed circuit board mounted alongside a custom electronic door locking mechanism.
The board is to include a built-in ECG acquisition system, audio and visual status indicators, as well as
the internal processing power required to perform biometric identification.
