This cardless security system leverages human electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics for authentication. It features an integrated printed circuit board (PCB) paired with a custom electronic door locking mechanism. The PCB houses an ECG acquisition system, audio/visual status indicators, and sufficient processing power to perform biometric identification. When an ECG credential is submitted, the system extracts 27 distinct fingerprint variables from the signal. These variables are then processed by a support vector machine (SVM) to generate a score that indicates the similarity between the submitted ECG and the authenticated user's ECG data. The SVM is trained on a comprehensive database of ECG signals, with system reliability being highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the training data used.
