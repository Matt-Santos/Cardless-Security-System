This database was created and contributed by Tatiana Lugovaya, who used it
in her master's thesis:

<p> The database contains 320 ECG recordings, obtained from 90 persons.  Each
recording contains:

<ul>
<li> ECG lead I, recorded for 20 seconds, digitized at 500 Hz with 12-bit
resolution over a nominal &plusmn;10 mV range;
<li> 10 annotated beats (unaudited R- and T-wave peaks annotations from an
automated detector);
<li> information (in the <tt>.hea</tt> file for the record) containing age,
gender and recording date.
</ul>

<p>
The records were obtained from volunteers (44 men and 46 women aged from 13
to 75 years who were students, colleagues, and friends of the author).  The
number of records for each person varies from 2 (collected during one day)
to 20 (collected periodically over 6 months).

<p> The raw ECG signals are rather noisy and contain both high and low
frequency noise components.  Each record includes both raw and filtered
signals:

<ul>
<li>Signal 0: ECG I (raw signal)
<li>Signal 1: ECG I filtered (filtered signal)
</ul>
